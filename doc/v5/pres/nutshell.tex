  \frametitle{This thesis in a nutshell}
  \begin{block}{Goal}
    On the context of a real-life application doing spectral
    clustering; the objective of this thesis is to emit an algorithm
    recommendation, for efficient 
    computation of the the Fiedler Vector on a single processor
    (application requirement). 
  \end{block}
  \begin{block}{Strategy}
    The Laplacian is SSPSD with first eigenpair $(0,\vec{1})$, look
    for algorithms that leverage those properties.
