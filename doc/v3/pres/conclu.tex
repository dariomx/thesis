  \frametitle{Conclusions}
  \begin{block}{Recommendations}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Prefer sparse algorithms (even if data fits in memory).
    \item If forced to use dense-matrix algorithms, prefer MRRR.
    \item Lanzos can be immediately used through JNI (app is in Java/Colt).
    \item If not urgent, worth it to port LOBPCG to Java (single vector).
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
  \begin{block}{Additional considerations}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Need to have efficient matrix representations (CSR or CSC) in Java.
    \item Need to port to Java SCC Algorithm (CSR).
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
  \begin{block}{Challenges found during thesis}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Numerical Linear Algebra is usually a graduate topic. Hard to find accessible entry-point material.
    \item Plenty of algoritms to explore (more time).
    \end{itemize}
