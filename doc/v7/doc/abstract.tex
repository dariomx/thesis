    On the context of a real-life application doing spectral
    clustering; the objective of this thesis is to emit an algorithm
    recommendation, for efficient 
    computation of the the Fiedler Vector on a single processor
    (application requirement). The algorithms considered were
    MRRR, Lanczos and LOBPCG; the first one is designed for dense
    matrices, hence not really a competitor here; but was 
    included for the sake of comparison (as the application currently
    uses a procedure of such kind). The algorithms were put into
    a competition through a series of tests on a commodity laptop, 
    using matrices generated from the application's domain. Even with
    an optimized Cholesky linear solver, the best known Lanczos
    implementation (ARPACK) failed to compete with LOBPCG, which comes
    as the clear winner of the experiment. The results suggest that
    for the biggest matrices considered (size $\approx$ 4500), the application can
    move from the minute into the subsecond scale; and a couple of seconds if we include the preprocessing to eliminate clustered eigenvalues.
