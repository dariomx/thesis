What is "preconditioned eigensolvers?" In one sentence those are matrix-free iterative methods for partial eigenvalue problems that take advantage of using preconditioners to accelerate convergence. A complete answer can be found in the papers "Preconditioned eigensolvers - an oxymoron?" and Preconditioned eigensolvers by Andrew Knyazev.
